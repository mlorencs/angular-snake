# Angular Snake Game

This is a very simple Angular project that I have created in the process of learning Angular. There's probably many things wrong with this project. This project is a 2D Snake Game. There's a bug with movement that snake can eat itself by changing directions too quickly. There's also no speed increase when snake collects food to make the game more difficult.

<br />
